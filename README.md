Connect 4 - Basic JS Front-End game
====================================
Overview
------------------------------------
A simple browser game created as a solution to Jose Portilla's proposed exercise in his 'Python and Django Full Stack Web Developer Bootcamp' course.

This project -and this course so far- has succcessfully recalled and expanded my previous front-end knowledge using HTML/CSS/JS, as well as my Bootstrap and JQuery framework handling. 

An awesome experience! You can find it here: https://www.udemy.com/course/python-and-django-full-stack-web-developer-bootcamp/

Intructions
------------------------------------
Place all three .html, .css and .js files in the same folder and run the .html in a browser, the game should automatically be playable.

Click on the empty circles to drop the chips. The first one to align 4 diagonally, vertically or horizontally, wins.

You can restart the game at any time by refresing the broswer.
